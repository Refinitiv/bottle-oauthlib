# Contributing guide

## Bug Reports

Before posting a new bug report, please make sure:
- you are testing with the latest version
- an existing issue is not already open at https://github.com/thomsonreuters/bottle-oauthlib/issues

If you still have an issue, then, you can open a new issue at https://github.com/thomsonreuters/bottle-oauthlib/issues/new and add maximum of details. We need at least :
- steps to reproduce,
- output/message displayed,
- behavior expected 

In other words, provide a small test case which can be run by others to confirm your bug.

However, in order to be merged into the core, we suggest to be PEP8 compliant, and be sure you're updating the unit tests along with the changes.
