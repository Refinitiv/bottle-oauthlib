## Context

Interested to implement your own OAuth2.0 provider in python ? You're at the right place.

Combine the excellent https://github.com/idan/oauthlib framework and the micro-framework https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle to provide OAuth2.0 authentication in only a couple of minutes.

OAuth2.0 basic knowledge is more than welcomed ! However, for novices users, as a rule of thumb, you must understand the OAuth2.0 is a delegation protocol. Basically, it delegates authentication (credentials) and authorization (scopes) to an application (client).

Note that you can use this project to implement the delegation part or the authorization server or the applications, or all combined. That's your choice.

For more information about OAuth2.0 fundamentals, check https://oauth.net/2/

## Quick start

Define rules into a oauthlib.RequestValidator class. See [oauthlib#implement-a-validator](https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2/server.html#implement-a-validator):
```python
class MyOAuth2_Validator(oauth2.RequestValidator):
    def authenticate_client_id(self, client_id, ..):
        """validate client_id"""

    def validate_user(self, username, password, client, ..):
        """validate username & password"""

    def validate_scopes(self, client_id, scopes, ..):
        """validate scope against the client"""

    (..)
```

Link it to a preconfigured `oauthlib` Server, then to a `bottle` app: 

```python
import bottle
from bottle_oauthlib import BottleOAuth2
from oauthlib import oauth2

validator = MyOAuth2_Validator()
server = oauth2.Server(validator)

app = bottle.Bottle()
app.auth = BottleOAuth2()
app.auth.initialize(server)
```

Finally, declare `bottle` endpoints to request token:
```python
@app.post('/token')
@app.auth.create_token_response()
def token():
    """an empty controller is enough for most cases"""
```

In addition, you can declare a _resource_ endpoint which verify a token and its optional scopes:
```python
@app.get('/calendar')
@app.auth.verify_request(scopes=['calendar'])
def access_calendar():
    return "Welcome {}, you have permissioned {} to use your calendar".format(
        bottle.request.oauth["user"],
        bottle.request.oauth["client"].client_id
    )
```

See the full example in our code source at [quickstart.py](https://github.com/thomsonreuters/bottle-oauthlib/blob/master/tests/examples/quickstart.py). Don't hesitate to copy it for your own project and its own unit tests at [test_quickstart.py](https://github.com/thomsonreuters/bottle-oauthlib/blob/master/tests/test_quickstart.py) to be confident in your updates.
